# CVE Analyzer
CVE Analyzer takes vulnerabilities (CVE's) reports as inputs (in CSV formats) and
provides the below summary by comparing those two reports (keeping one as base
data and the other one as to be compared data):-

1. True Positives - When the CVE is present in both the data's
2. False Negative - When the CVE is present in base data and it's not present in provided data
3. False Positive - When the CVE is not present in base data and it's present in provided data

## Note
Both the reports should have a column named 'CVE ID'

## Usage
```
$ bin/CVE_Analyzer -h
Usage: CVE_Analyzer [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -b BASE_DATA_FILE, --base=BASE_DATA_FILE
                        Base Data File in CSV Format
  -f RESULTS_DATA_FILE, --results=RESULTS_DATA_FILE
                        Actual Results Data to be compared with Base Data in
                        CSV
```

## Example
```
$ bin/CVE_Analyzer -b sample_reports/base.csv -f sample_reports/2008.csv
# of CVE's in Base Data     :  2
# of CVE's in Provided Data :  4
# of True Positives         :  1
# of False Negatives        :  1
# of False Positives        :  3
